\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{chap_5}

In this last chapter, we will summarize the work presented in this thesis. After that, we will present some directions for future work that could be explored to further improve our solution and the impact it can have in malware analysis research.

\section{Conclusion}

\matteo{briefly summarize the work (in chapter x we saw... then we introduced... after that...)}

\matteo{Talk about what can be inferred from this study, what this study highlighted and why it is important}

\section{Future Work}

\matteo{Expand this work to other fuzzing frameworks? We found some issues that are general (e.g. use as many sanitizers as possible), but also issues that are specific to the frameworks we tested: other frameworks might have different issues specific to them}

\matteo{Provide general guidelines for fuzzing frameworks. Right now there is none, users just adhere to common sense; we could study and propose guidelines that prevent the issues we witnessed.}

\matteo{can we think of something else? maybe something related to sanitizers}
